 <h1>'Goal! The Dream Begins'</h1>
 <h4>[Summary]</h4>
 <p>The movie, ‘Goal! The Dream Begins’ directed by Danny Cannonis a fictional story of a Mexican-American, Santiago Munez, living in Los Angeles. The plot revolves around the life of Santiago, from a footballer to a professional soccer player. As an underprivileged Mexican-American immigrant growing up in the poor sector of Los Angeles, Santiago seemed destined to follow his father’s footsteps, laboring at menial jobs to earn just enough money to support his family. His father wanted him to join the family business and helped their family financially. Though Santiago was incredibly talented in soccer, his father discouraged him from playing soccer, believing that it was only a worthless fantasy. He was skeptical and disapproved his dream. He refused to accept his child’s potential. However, Santiago’s grandmother (Colon) could see the potential that lied within her grandson and supported him in reaching his ambition.

    <p>
        One day, a former British professional, Glen Foy, spotted Santiago playing in a pickup game, and promised him a try out for Newcastle United. When Santiago was given the chance of a life time, he had to made a decision whether he should leave his family and his life in Los Angeles and traveled to England to fulfill his dream. Santiago’s greatest obstacle was he had no money to buy an air ticket to England. His father has taken his savings to buy a truck for the family business. He was frustrated and he thought there was the end of his dream. But his grandmother sold her jewelry and he left without his father’s knowledge to England to achieve his dream.
    </p>
<p>Santiago went through trials and tribulations to earn his rightful place in the squad. He soon realised that becoming professional soccer player is not as easy as it looks and that his father may have been right. As things began to get tougher, Santiago realised that he must first believe in himself before anyone else will. His hard work paid off as he eventually was noticed by the coach and made to the reserve team. Like Santiago, he did not give up although he got screwed several times. However, just believing we can do something does not mean there will not be any problems. We need to look for solutions to our problems. Santiago tried to adapt to the rough-and-tumble of the English game such as he had never played in rain or mud before and he also tried to avoid the immoral lifestyles of his teammates.</p>
<p>Once in England, he faces one challenge after another trying to make the team. Glen turns out to be loyal and enthusiastic supporter of this talented young man who, after a setback, manages to win a slot as a trainee. Santiago falls in love with Roz (Anna Friel), a nurse who sees that he is different from other men with his single-minded focus on his dream. He is also taken under the wings of Gavin Harris (Alessandro Nivola), a superstar soccer player who introduces him to the fast lane of fame and fortune with all its attendant problems. The manager of the Newcastle United goes out of his way to give Santiago the time he needs to learn the ways of English soccer.</p>
<p>Despite of having asthma, Santiago never loses his grip of becoming a professional soccer play. At first, he was in denial of his case. He even lied during his physical examination. Yet, when his league manager, Mr. Dornhelm, learned about his condition, he immediately advised him to see a physician for a thorough check up. As a result of this courageous revelation, Santiago’s morale lifted up. Denial is a negative parcel of life. It is a common mechanism we adopt to cope with our difficulties.</p>
<p>We also see that when Santiago’s father died of heart attack while he was in England, he had to make the choice between pursuing self-interest over duty to family that Santiago has to make. Finally, he has chosen to continue with the pursuit of his dream.</p>
<p>In this film, there are two great Samaritans behind Santiago’s success. First is his grandmother who gave Santiago the air ticket to his dream. Second is Mr. Glen Foy the retired professional football player who discovered Santiago’s talent. Despite of failures and frustrations, he still helps Santiago in any means.</p>
<h4>Conclusion:-</h4>
<p>Even though this film is a fiction it brings out various truths in life. As we relate well to stories, ‘Goal! The Dream Begins’ is a charming story which will appeal to all especially for those who have left their innermost dreams behind. We need to believe in ourselves and follow our dreams. This movie inspires us not to give up but nurture our dreams until they are fulfilled.</p>
